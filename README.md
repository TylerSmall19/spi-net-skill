# Rolling Spider Network Initiative (SpiNet)
#### Voice Controlled Drone Interface
-------------------------------
### Set Up (Prerequisites)
1. Set up the required [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/account/) and [PubNub](https://admin.pubnub.com/#/register?pi_visitorid=219166828&psc=WC-Tracking&pt=wc-tracking) accounts.
2. Ensure you have a current version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed. You can check versions with `node -v`.

This portion of the set up will be the most involved, but you should have an app fully functional within 10 minutes or earlier, depending on the familiarity you have with AWS (Amazon Web Services) Lambda, Pub Nub, and the Alexa Skills interface.

This readme assumes basic familiarity with getting an Alexa Skill configured. If you're new to Alexa entirely, consider following [Amazon's guide](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-skill-tutorial) before diving in.
